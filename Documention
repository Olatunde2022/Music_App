This music player  app is a GUI project created using Tkinter lib. 
To access the player, it requires user to have pygame install on the IDE or Editor.
The components must be in a same folder including the music files.
This player is quite explanatory and simple to use.
Kindly note that this project is still under construcrion therefore, necessary upgrame would be made as soon as possible. Thanks.
